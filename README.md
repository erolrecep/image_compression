# Image Compression

In this repository, I am experimenting multiple algorithms and their performance for image compression and color quantization. 
I am also exploring the possibility of parallelizing these algorithms to improve performance. 

As a result, these algorithms will be used for another research study for characterizing image compression affect on ML, DL, CV, and VLM pipelines.

## Algorithms
 - PCA, Principal Component Analysis
 - K-means
 - Autoencoders


## Functions
 - load_image()
 - display_image()
 - display_centroids()
 - get_image_pixels()
 - plot_pixels_rgb_3d()
 - plot_pixels_rgb_2d()
 - calculate_psnr()
 - calculate_ssim()
 - calculate_compression_ratio()
